MYSQL USER MANAGEMENT:
Employers and job seekers will share the same user authentication system but with different roles assigned.
Upon registration, users can select their role and will be redirected to the relevant features and functionalities.
This approach offers flexibility while still differentiating between employer and job seeker functionalities.



User Registration:

1. Develop a registration page where users can create an account.
Include fields for common information like name, email, and password.
Add an additional field for users to select their role (e.g., employer or job seeker).
Validate the registration form to ensure all required fields are filled correctly.
User Login:

2. Create a login page where users can authenticate with their credentials.
After successful login, redirect users to the appropriate dashboard based on their role.
Role Assignment:

3. Upon registration or login, retrieve the user's role from the database.
Store the user's role in the user's session or as part of their authentication token.
Use this role information throughout the application to control access and display relevant features.
Redirect to Relevant Functionality:

4. Depending on the user's role, redirect them to the appropriate functionality after login.
For employers, redirect them to the employer dashboard where they can manage job postings, view applications, etc.
For job seekers, redirect them to the job seeker dashboard where they can search for jobs, apply, etc.
Role-Based Access Control:

5. Implement role-based access control to restrict access to certain functionalities based on the user's role.
In the backend, validate the user's role before allowing them to perform specific actions (e.g., posting a job, applying for a job).
In the frontend, hide or disable features that are not relevant to the user's role.
User Profile:

6. Create a user profile page where users can view and update their information.
Allow job seekers to add their resumes, cover letters, and other relevant details.
Provide employers with the ability to add their company information and logo.
Dashboard and Notifications:

7. Develop separate dashboards for employers and job seekers, tailored to their specific needs.
Implement a notification system to inform users about relevant updates (e.g., new job postings, application status changes).
Testing and Feedback:

8. Regularly test your application to ensure all functionalities are working correctly.
Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary updates.
