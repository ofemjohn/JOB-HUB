MYSQL USER MANAGEMENT:
Employers and job seekers will share the same user authentication system but with different roles assigned.

User Login:

After successful login, redirect users to the appropriate dashboard based on their role.
Role Assignment:

3. Upon registration or login, retrieve the user's role from the database.
Store the user's role in the user's session or as part of their authentication token.
Use this role information throughout the application to control access and display relevant features.
Redirect to Relevant Functionality:

4. Depending on the user's role, redirect them to the appropriate functionality after login.
For employers, redirect them to the employer dashboard where they can manage job postings, view applications, etc.
For job seekers, redirect them to the job seeker dashboard where they can search for jobs, apply, etc.
Role-Based Access Control:

5. Implement role-based access control to restrict access to certain functionalities based on the user's role.
In the backend, validate the user's role before allowing them to perform specific actions (e.g., posting a job, applying for a job).
In the frontend, hide or disable features that are not relevant to the user's role.
User Profile:

6. Create a user profile page where users can view and update their information.
Allow job seekers to add their resumes, cover letters, and other relevant details.
Provide employers with the ability to add their company information and logo.
Dashboard and Notifications:

7. Develop separate dashboards for employers and job seekers, tailored to their specific needs.

Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary updates.

When a user submits an application, check if the application_link is provided in the associated job listing.
If an application_link is available, redirect the user to that link to continue the application process on the third-party website.
If no application_link is available, send the application details (including the uploaded application file) to the email address specified in the job listing.
To implement the email functionality, you can use a library like Flask-Mail or a third-party email service provider such as SendGrid or Mailgun. These libraries provide APIs to send emails programmatically.
